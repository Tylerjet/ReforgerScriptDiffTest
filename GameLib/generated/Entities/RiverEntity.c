/*!
Entity for a single river.

Must have a shape entity as a parent - central points are taken from it.

This is available in WB and serialized.
It's not actually rendered or linked to a scene tree (can be too big for that).
Instead, it just creates multiple partial entities,
places them to the world and manages them.
