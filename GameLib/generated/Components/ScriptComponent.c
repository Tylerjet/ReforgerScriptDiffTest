* Parent class for all components created in script.
* Every ScriptComponent is being created in Entity's constructor and may receive following events
* 1. OnComponentInsert is being called when component is created. This is last event Workbench sends in World Editor edit mode.
* 2. EOnInit is being called after all components have been inserted and if the component registered event mask EV_INIT
* 3. EOnActivate is being called if the entity was flagged as TFL_ACTIVE and if the component is active. The component is active by default.
* 4. EOnXXXs are being called base on event mask component registered
* 5. EOnDeactivate is being called when Deactivate is called or when the component is being to be removed. Component must be active to be deactivated.
* 6. OnComponentRemove is being called after a component is removed.
* 7. EOnDelete is being called after entity is going to be destroyed.
