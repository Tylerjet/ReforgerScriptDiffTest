* BaseRplComponent
* ================
* A convenience wrapper for RplNode in the ECS. Its role is to serve as an
* accessor to the nodes data as well as collector of replicated items within
* the entity component hierarchy.
*
* During its initialization it traverses the hierarchy and looks for replicated
* items, collects them and registers into the replication pipeline.
*
* Also listens to changes within the entity component hierarchy and calls the
* appropriate replication methods to replicate the hierarchy changes to
* replicas.
*
* All of its features can be disabled, overridden or handled manually. For the
* most fine grained access to data its advisable to use the RplNode itself.
*
*
* Initialization
* --------------
* The RplNode provides a accurate role and ownership from the time of its
* construction.
*
* Then in EOnInit the InsertToReplication method is called, the hierarchy is
* traversed and replicated items are collected. The component looks for another
* BaseRplComponent instance in the direction upwards in the entity component
* hierarchy. If such instance is found it will become responsible for
* registration of this child instance.
*
* The BaseRplComponent has a low priority setup to make it possibly the last
* component to be initialized. If any of the components within the hierarchy
* would spawn children this way they would get registered into the pipeline
* too.
*
* WARNING: If anything gets spawned after the EOnInit is called on the
* BaseRplComponent instance it won't get registered at all.
*
* If the user chooses to disable the SELF_INSERT mechanism he will become
* ultimately responsible for calling the InsertToReplication method himself.
*
* Hierarchy changes
* -----------------
* The component handles the hierarchy changes automatically by default. Its a
* convenience function that should be turned off for more complex usage.
*
* WARNING: Not every replicated entity can change hierarchy at will. It has to
* be an owner of an RplNode (BaseRplComponent) as the Nodes are immutable
* collections in replication pipeline. There is no such mechanism that will
* prevent the user from doing so but it will cause a serious harm and
* malfunction.
*
* Destruction
* -----------
* Upon destruction the component will unregister its contents from replication
* pipeline automatically.
